## Where to stay

### Wedding night

Great news! If you come from far away, you won't have to spend time looking for a place to stay. We have booked the whole venue just for us, so you can spend the night there at an incredibly discounted price (c/a Â£20 pp). If interested, contact us and we will sort out the booking for you. Hurry, there are limited spaces!

### Extending your stay

If you are tempted to spend more than one night in beautiful Italy (we can't blame you), we have partnered with the wedding venue to guarantee an additional discount on extra nights. For more info, contact us or [Agriturismo Podere Casato](https://www.agriturismopoderecasato.it/) (Tel: +39 0577 352002)
